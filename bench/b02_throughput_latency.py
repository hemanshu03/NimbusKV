"""b02_throughput_latency.py

Single-threaded throughput/latency for every core operation, PLUS
multi-threaded throughput at increasing thread counts. On this sandbox's
single logical CPU, adding threads cannot add real parallelism -- what
it *can* and does reveal is pure GIL/lock contention overhead: context
switching, retry storms on optimistic concurrency, and scheduler churn.
That overhead is real and worth charting on its own; it is explicitly
NOT a proxy for how this would scale on real multi-core hardware.
