"""b01_correctness.py

Before measuring speed, prove the safety claims. A fast-but-wrong store is
worthless, so this file is charted too (as a pass/fail + retry-count bar),
not just narrated.

Claims under test:
1. atomic() never loses an update under concurrent writers (the whole
   point of optimistic-concurrency vs a plain dict+lock).
2. mset() is truly atomic: a concurrent reader never observes a partial
   multi-key update (the "move money between two accounts" example from
   the README, actually enforced under a tight reader/writer race).
3. ConflictRetryExceeded is a real, reachable failure mode, not just
   documentation -- and it fires exactly where the retry budget says it
   should.
4. TTL expiry vs. manual delete/reschedule races don't double-fire or
   resurrect a key (the generation-counter bug the docs mention fixing).
