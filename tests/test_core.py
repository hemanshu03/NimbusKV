"""test_core.py - basic CRUD and concurrency-correctness tests.

The concurrency tests here are the ones that actually matter for
NimbusKV's core claim: no lost updates under contention, regardless of
how many threads are writing at once. This is what should be re-run
(and re-verified) on a free-threaded (3.13t/3.14t) interpreter, not
just standard Python.
