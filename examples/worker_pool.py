"""worker_pool.py - producer/consumer coordination without polling.

This is the example that actually demonstrates why NimbusKV's reactivity
matters, not just its caching: multiple worker threads pick up jobs and
report results, a dispatcher waits on completion with wait_for() instead
of a sleep-and-poll loop, and atomic() coordinates a shared "jobs done"
counter safely across threads.
