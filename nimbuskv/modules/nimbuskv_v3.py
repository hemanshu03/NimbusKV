"""nimbuskv_v3.py — NimbusKV v3 public API.

This is the module you actually use: ``from nimbuskv import NimbusKV``.

Architecture, in one paragraph: a :class:`~.reactive_core.ReactiveStore`
(in-memory, immutable-snapshot, optimistic-concurrency core -- reads
never block, writes retry on conflict instead of locking) is always the
live source of truth. An :class:`~.ttl.ExpiryScheduler` fires TTL expiry
against it. An optional :class:`~.persistence.PersistenceBackend`
(Memory/SQLite/Redis) mirrors writes through for durability and
rehydrates on startup -- but never sits on the read path.

Runs correctly on standard GIL Python and on free-threaded Python
(3.13t/3.14t) from the exact same code -- the concurrency strategy adapts
automatically (see ``nimbuskv.LOCK_FREE_MODE``), you don't need to do
anything differently for either.

Async honesty: for the default in-memory backend, ``aset``/``aget``/etc.
are genuinely non-blocking -- no thread spawned, because there's no real
I/O to hide behind an executor. When a real backend (SQLite/Redis) is
attached, *only* the persistence write is delegated to a thread-pool
executor -- the in-memory part of every operation still never blocks.

Sandbox (isolating callback execution) is intentionally not included in
this build. It's planned for a future release with real isolation
(subprocess/WASM-based), rather than the timeout-only wrapper v2 shipped
under that name.

class NimbusKV:
    """Reactive, TTL-aware, optimistic-concurrency key/value store.

    The main class you'll use. Behaves like a thread-safe dict with
    expiry and a subscription/notification system layered on top, and
    an optional durable backend.

    Works correctly on standard GIL Python and free-threaded Python
    (3.13t/3.14t) from the same code path -- concurrency strategy adapts
    automatically underneath (see :data:`nimbuskv.LOCK_FREE_MODE`); you
    don't pass any flag for this.

    Can be used as a context manager to guarantee cleanup
    (``scheduler.stop()`` and ``backend.close()``) even if an exception
    is raised:

    Example:
        >>> from nimbuskv import NimbusKV
        >>> with NimbusKV() as ld:
        ...     ld.set("foo", 123)
        ...     print(ld.get("foo"))

                  survives a restart.

                loaded into memory immediately (already-expired keys
                are skipped) before this constructor returns.
